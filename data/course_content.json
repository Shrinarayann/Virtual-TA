Data Preparation 6. Data Analysis Project 2 7. Data Visualization Crawling with the CLI Since websites are a common source of data, we often download entire websites (crawling) and then process them offline. Web crawling is essential in many data-driven scenarios: Data mining and analysis: Gathering structured data from multiple pages for market research, competitive analysis, or academic research Content archiving: Creating offline copies of websites for preservation or backup purposes SEO analysis: Analyzing site structure, metadata, and content to improve search rankings Legal compliance: Capturing website content for regulatory or compliance documentation Website migration: Creating a complete copy before moving to a new platform or design Offline access: Downloading educational resources, documentation, or reference materials for use without internet connection The most commonly used tool for fetching websites is wget. It is pre-installed in many UNIX distributions and easy to install. To crawl the IIT Madras Data Science Program website for example, you could run: wget \\ --recursive \\ --level=3 \\ --no-parent \\ --convert-links \\ --adjust-extension \\ --compression=auto \\ --accept html,htm \\ --directory-prefix=./ds \\ https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/ Copy to clipboard Error Copied Here’s what each option does: --recursive: Enables recursive downloading (following links) --level=3: Limits recursion depth to 3 levels from the initial URL --no-parent: Restricts crawling to only URLs below the initial directory --convert-links: Converts all links in downloaded documents to work locally --adjust-extension: Adds proper extensions to files (.html, .jpg, etc.) based on MIME types --compression=auto: Automatically handles compressed content (gzip, deflate) --accept html,htm: Only downloads files with these extensions --directory-prefix=./ds: Saves all downloaded files to the specified directory wget2 is a better version of wget and supports HTTP2, parallel connections, and only updates modified sites. The syntax is (mostly) the same. wget2 \\ --recursive \\ --level=3 \\ --no-parent \\ --convert-links \\ --adjust-extension \\ --compression=auto \\ --accept html,htm \\ --directory-prefix=./ds \\ https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/ Copy to clipboard Error Copied There are popular free and open-source alternatives to Wget: Wpull Wpull is a wget‐compatible Python crawler that supports on-disk resumption, WARC output, and PhantomJS integration. uvx wpull \\ --recursive \\ --level=3 \\ --no-parent \\ --convert-links \\ --adjust-extension \\ --compression=auto \\ --accept html,htm \\ --directory-prefix=./ds \\ https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/ Copy to clipboard Error Copied HTTrack HTTrack is dedicated website‐mirroring tool with rich filtering and link‐conversion options. httrack \"https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/\" \\ -O \"./ds\" \\ \"+*.study.iitm.ac.in/ds/*\" \\ -r3 Copy to clipboard Error Copied Robots.txt robots.txt is a standard file found in a website’s root directory that specifies which parts of the site should not be accessed by web crawlers. It’s part of the Robots Exclusion Protocol, an ethical standard for web crawling. Why it’s important: Server load protection: Prevents excessive traffic that could overload servers Privacy protection: Keeps sensitive or private content from being indexed Legal compliance: Respects website owners’ rights to control access to their content Ethical web citizenship: Shows respect for website administrators’ wishes How to override robots.txt restrictions: wget, wget2: Use -e robots=off httrack: Use -s0 wpull: Use --no-robots When to override robots.txt (use with discretion): Only bypass robots.txt when: You have explicit permission from the website owner You’re crawling your own website The content is publicly accessible and your crawling won’t cause server issues You’re conducting authorized security testing Remember that bypassing robots.txt without legitimate reason may: Violate terms of service Lead to IP banning Result in legal consequences in some jurisdictions Cause reputation damage to your organization Always use the minimum necessary crawling speed and scope, and consider contacting website administrators for permission when in doubt.

Data Sourcing 5. Data Preparation 6. Data Analysis Project 2 7. Data Visualization Hybrid Retrieval Augmented Generation (Hybrid RAG) with TypeSense Hybrid RAG combines semantic (vector) search with traditional keyword search to improve retrieval accuracy and relevance. By mixing exact text matches with embedding-based similarity, you get the best of both worlds: precision when keywords are present, and semantic recall when phrasing varies. TypeSense makes this easy with built-in hybrid search and automatic embedding generation. Below is a fully self-contained Hybrid RAG tutorial using TypeSense, Python, and the command line. Install and run TypeSense Install TypeSense. mkdir typesense-data docker run -p 8108:8108 \\ -v typesense-data:/data typesense/typesense:28.0 \\ --data-dir /data \\ --api-key=secret-key \\ --enable-cors Copy to clipboard Error Copied docker run: spins up a containerized TypeSense server on port 8108 -p 8108:8108 maps host port to container port. -v typesense-data:/data mounts a Docker volume for persistence. --data-dir /data points TypeSense at that volume. --api-key=secret-key secures your API. --enable-cors allows browser-based requests. Expected output: Docker logs showing TypeSense startup messages, such as Started Typesense API server. Listening on http://0.0.0.0:8108. Embed and import documents into TypeSense Follow the steps in the RAG with the CLI tutorial to create a chunks.json that has one {id, content} JSON object per line. TypeSense supports automatic embedding of documents. We’ll use that capability. Save the following as addnotes.py and run it with uv run addnotes.py. # /// script # requires-python = \">=3.13\" # dependencies = [\"httpx\"] # /// import json import httpx import os headers = {\"X-TYPESENSE-API-KEY\": \"secret-key\"} schema = { \"name\": \"notes\", \"fields\": [ {\"name\": \"id\", \"type\": \"string\", \"facet\": False}, {\"name\": \"content\", \"type\": \"string\", \"facet\": False}, { \"name\": \"embedding\", \"type\": \"float[]\", \"embed\": { \"from\": [\"content\"], \"model_config\": { \"model_name\": \"openai/text-embedding-3-small\", \"api_key\": os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"), }, }, }, ], } with open(\"chunks.json\", \"r\") as f: chunks = [json.loads(line) for line in f.readlines()] with httpx.Client() as client: # Create the collection if client.get(f\"http://localhost:8108/collections/notes\", headers=headers).status_code == 404: r = client.post(\"http://localhost:8108/collections\", json=schema, headers=headers) # Embed the chunks result = client.post( \"http://localhost:8108/collections/notes/documents/import?action=emplace\", headers={**headers, \"Content-Type\": \"text/plain\"}, data=\"\\n\".join(json.dumps(chunk) for chunk in chunks), ) print(result.text) Copy to clipboard Error Copied httpx.Client: an HTTP client for Python. Collection schema: id and content fields plus an embedding field with auto-generated embeddings from OpenAI. Auto-embedding: the embed block instructs TypeSense to call the specified model for each document. GET /collections/notes: checks existence. POST /collections: creates the collection. POST /collections/notes/documents/import?action=emplace: bulk upsert documents, embedding them on the fly. Expected output: A JSON summary string like {\"success\": X, \"failed\": 0} indicating how many docs were imported. (On timeouts, re-run until all chunks are processed.) 4. Run a hybrid search and answer a question Now, we can use a single curl against the Multi-Search endpoint to combine keyword and vector search as a hybrid search: Q=\"What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?\" payload=$(jq -n --arg coll \"notes\" --arg q \"$Q\" \\ '{ searches: [ { collection: $coll, q: $q, query_by: \"content,embedding\", sort_by: \"_text_match:desc\", prefix: false, exclude_fields: \"embedding\" } ] }' ) curl -s 'http://localhost:8108/multi_search' \\ -H \"X-TYPESENSE-API-KEY: secret-key\" \\ -d \"$payload\" \\ | jq -r '.results[].hits[].document.content' \\ | llm -s \"${Q} - \\$Answer ONLY from these notes. Cite verbatim from the notes.\" \\ | uvx streamdown Copy to clipboard Error Copied query_by: \"content,embedding\": tells TypeSense to score by both keyword and vector similarity. sort_by: \"_text_match:desc\": boosts exact text hits. exclude_fields: \"embedding\": keeps responses lightweight. curl -d: posts the search request. jq -r: extracts each hit’s content. See jq manual llm -s and uvx streamdown: generate and stream a grounded answer. Expected output: The raw matched snippets printed first. Then a concise, streamed LLM answer citing the note verbatim.

Data Visualization Unicode Ever noticed when you copy-paste some text and get garbage symbols? Or see garbage when you load a CSV file? This video explains why. It covers how computers store text (called character encoding) and why it sometimes goes wonky. Learn about ASCII (the original 7-bit encoding system that could only handle 128 characters), why that wasn’t enough for global languages, and how modern solutions like Unicode save the day by letting us use any character from any language. Some programs try to guess encodings (sometimes badly!). A signature called BOM (Byte Order Mark)helps computers know exactly how to read text files correctly. Learn how Unicode, UTF-8 and character encoding works. This is a common gotcha when building apps that handle international text - something bootcamps often skip but developers and data scientists regularly face in the real world. Unicode is fundamental for data scientists working with international data. Here are key concepts you need to understand: Character Encodings: Different ways to represent text in computers ASCII (7-bit): Limited to 128 characters, English-only UTF-8: Variable-width encoding, backwards compatible with ASCII UTF-16: Fixed-width encoding, used in Windows and Java UTF-32: Fixed-width encoding, memory inefficient but simple Common encoding issues you’ll encounter: # Reading files with explicit encoding with open('file.txt', encoding='utf-8') as f: text = f.read() # Handling encoding errors import pandas as pd df = pd.read_csv('data.csv', encoding='utf-8', errors='replace') # Detecting file encoding import chardet with open('unknown.txt', 'rb') as f: result = chardet.detect(f.read()) print(result['encoding']) Copy to clipboard Error Copied Previous JavaScript tools: npx Next Browser: DevTools",

Data Visualization Function Calling with OpenAI Function Calling allows Large Language Models to convert natural language into structured function calls. This is perfect for building chatbots and AI assistants that need to interact with your backend systems. OpenAI supports Function Calling – a way for LLMs to suggest what functions to call and how. Here’s a minimal example using Python and OpenAI’s function calling that identifies the weather in a given location. # /// script # requires-python = \">=3.11\" # dependencies = [ # \"httpx\", # ] # /// import httpx import os from typing import Dict, Any def query_gpt(user_input: str, tools: list[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, Any]: response = httpx.post( \"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\", headers={ \"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')}\", \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\", }, json={ \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini\", \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_input}], \"tools\": tools, \"tool_choice\": \"auto\", }, ) return response.json()[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"] WEATHER_TOOL = { \"type\": \"function\", \"function\": { \"name\": \"get_weather\", \"description\": \"Get the current weather for a location\", \"parameters\": { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"location\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"City name or coordinates\"} }, \"required\": [\"location\"], \"additionalProperties\": False, }, \"strict\": True, }, } if __name__ == \"__main__\": response = query_gpt(\"What is the weather in San Francisco?\", [WEATHER_TOOL]) print([tool_call[\"function\"] for tool_call in response[\"tool_calls\"]]) Copy to clipboard Error Copied How to define functions The function definition is a JSON schema with a few OpenAI specific properties. See the Supported schemas. Here’s an example of a function definition for scheduling a meeting: MEETING_TOOL = { \"type\": \"function\", \"function\": { \"name\": \"schedule_meeting\", \"description\": \"Schedule a meeting room for a specific date and time\", \"parameters\": { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"date\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Meeting date in YYYY-MM-DD format\" }, \"time\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Meeting time in HH:MM format\" }, \"meeting_room\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Name of the meeting room\" } }, \"required\": [\"date\", \"time\", \"meeting_room\"], \"additionalProperties\": False }, \"strict\": True } } Copy to clipboard Error Copied How to define multiple functions You can define multiple functions by passing a list of function definitions to the tools parameter. Here’s an example of a list of function definitions for handling employee expenses and calculating performance bonuses: tools = [ { \"type\": \"function\", \"function\": { \"name\": \"get_expense_balance\", \"description\": \"Get expense balance for an employee\", \"parameters\": { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"employee_id\": { \"type\": \"integer\", \"description\": \"Employee ID number\" } }, \"required\": [\"employee_id\"], \"additionalProperties\": False }, \"strict\": True } }, { \"type\": \"function\", \"function\": { \"name\": \"calculate_performance_bonus\", \"description\": \"Calculate yearly performance bonus for an employee\", \"parameters\": { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"employee_id\": { \"type\": \"integer\", \"description\": \"Employee ID number\" }, \"current_year\": { \"type\": \"integer\", \"description\": \"Year to calculate bonus for\" } }, \"required\": [\"employee_id\", \"current_year\"], \"additionalProperties\": False }, \"strict\": True } } ] Copy to clipboard Error Copied Best Practices: Use Strict Mode Always set strict: True to ensure valid function calls Define all required parameters Set additionalProperties: False Use tool choice Set tool_choice: \"required\" to ensure that the model will always call one or more tools The default is tool_choice: \"auto\" which means the model will choose a tool only if appropriate Clear Descriptions Write detailed function and parameter descriptions Include expected formats and units Mention any constraints or limitations Error Handling Validate function inputs before execution Return clear error messages Handle missing or invalid parameters Previous Hybrid RAG with TypeSense Next LLM Agents",

Data Preparation 6. Data Analysis Project 2 7. Data Visualization Converting PDFs to Markdown PDF documents are ubiquitous in academic, business, and technical contexts, but extracting and repurposing their content can be challenging. This tutorial explores various command-line tools for converting PDFs to Markdown format, with a focus on preserving structure and formatting suitable for different use cases, including preparation for Large Language Models (LLMs). Use Cases: LLM training and fine-tuning: Create clean text data from PDFs for AI model training Knowledge base creation: Transform PDFs into searchable, editable markdown documents Content repurposing: Convert academic papers and reports for web publication Data extraction: Pull structured content from PDF documents for analysis Accessibility: Convert PDFs to more accessible formats for screen readers Citation and reference management: Extract bibliographic information from academic papers Documentation conversion: Transform technical PDFs into maintainable documentation PyMuPDF4LLM PyMuPDF4LLM is a specialized component of the PyMuPDF library that generates Markdown specifically formatted for Large Language Models. It produces high-quality markdown with good preservation of document structure. It’s specifically optimized for producing text that works well with LLMs, removing irrelevant formatting while preserving semantic structure. Requires PyTorch, which adds dependencies but enables more advanced processing capabilities. PyMuPDF4LLM uses MuPDF as its PDF parsing engine. PyMuPDF is emerging as a strong default for PDF text extraction due to its accuracy and performance in handling complex PDF structures. PYTHONUTF8=1 uv run --with pymupdf4llm python -c 'import pymupdf4llm; h = open(\"pymupdf4llm.md\", \"w\"); h.write(pymupdf4llm.to_markdown(\"$FILE.pdf\"))' Copy to clipboard Error Copied PYTHONUTF8=1: Forces Python to use UTF-8 encoding regardless of system locale uv run --with pymupdf4llm: Uses uv package manager to run Python with the pymupdf4llm package python -c '...': Executes Python code directly from the command line import pymupdf4llm: Imports the PDF-to-Markdown module h = open(\"pymupdf4llm.md\", \"w\"): Creates a file to write the markdown output h.write(pymupdf4llm.to_markdown(\"$FILE.pdf\")): Converts the PDF to markdown and writes to file Markitdown Markitdown is Microsoft’s tool for converting various document formats to Markdown, including PDFs, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, and ZIP files. It’s a versatile multi-format converter that handles PDFs via PDFMiner, DOCX via Mammoth, XLSX via Pandas, and PPTX via Python-PPTX. Good for batch processing of mixed document types. The quality of PDF conversion is generally good but may struggle with complex layouts or heavily formatted documents. PYTHONUTF8=1 uvx markitdown $FILE.pdf > markitdown.md Copy to clipboard Error Copied PYTHONUTF8=1: Forces Python to use UTF-8 encoding uvx markitdown: Runs the markitdown tool via the uv package manager $FILE.pdf: The input PDF file > markitdown.md: Redirects output to a markdown file Unstructured Unstructured is rapidly becoming the de facto library for parsing over 40 different file types. It is excellent for extracting text and tables from diverse document formats. Particularly useful for generating clean content to pass to LLMs. Strong community support and actively maintained. GROBID If you specifically need to parse references from text-native PDFs or reliably OCR’ed ones, GROBID remains the de facto choice. It excels at extracting structured bibliographic information with high accuracy. # Start GROBID service docker run -t --rm -p 8070:8070 lfoppiano/grobid:0.7.2 # Process PDF with curl curl -X POST -F \"input=@paper.pdf\" localhost:8070/api/processFulltextDocument > references.tei.xml Copy to clipboard Error Copied Mistral OCR API Mistral OCR offers an end-to-end cloud API that preserves both text and layout, making it easier to isolate specific sections like References. It shows the most promise currently, though it requires post-processing. Azure Document Intelligence API For enterprise users already in the Microsoft ecosystem, Azure Document Intelligence provides excellent raw OCR with enterprise SLAs. May require custom model training or post-processing to match GROBID’s reference extraction capabilities. Other libraries Docling is IBM’s document understanding library that supports PDF conversion. It can be challenging to install, particularly on Windows and some Linux distributions. Offers advanced document understanding capabilities beyond simple text extraction. MegaParse takes a comprehensive approach using LibreOffice, Pandoc, Tesseract OCR, and other tools. It has Robust handling of different document types but requires an OpenAI API key for some features. Good for complex documents but has significant dependencies.

Data Preparation 6. Data Analysis Project 2 7. Data Visualization Project: TDS Virtual TA Create a virtual Teaching Assistant Discourse responder. Background You are a clever student who has joined IIT Madras’ Online Degree in Data Science. You have just enrolled in the Tools in Data Science course. Out of kindness for your teaching assistants, you have decided to build an API that can automatically answer student questions on their behalf based on: Course content with content for TDS Jan 2025 as on 15 Apr 2025. TDS Discourse posts with content from 1 Jan 2025 - 14 Apr 2025. Scrape the data To make sure you can answer these questions, you will need to extract the data from the above source. Create an API Your application exposes an API endpoint. You may host it anywhere. Let’s assume it’s at https://app.example.com/api/. The endpoint must accept a POST request, e.g. POST https://app.example.com/api/ with a student question as well as optional base64 file attachments as JSON. For example, here’s how anyone can make a request: curl \"https://app.example.com/api/\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d \"{\\\"question\\\": \\\"Should I use gpt-4o-mini which AI proxy supports, or gpt3.5 turbo?\\\", \\\"image\\\": \\\"$(base64 -w0 project-tds-virtual-ta-q1.webp)\\\"}\" Copy to clipboard Error Copied This is a real question and uses this screenshot: The response must be a JSON object like this: { \"answer\": \"You must use `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125`, even if the AI Proxy only supports `gpt-4o-mini`. Use the OpenAI API directly for this question.\", \"links\": [ { \"url\": \"https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga5-question-8-clarification/155939/4\", \"text\": \"Use the model that’s mentioned in the question.\" }, { \"url\": \"https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga5-question-8-clarification/155939/3\", \"text\": \"My understanding is that you just have to use a tokenizer, similar to what Prof. Anand used, to get the number of tokens and multiply that by the given rate.\" } ] } Copy to clipboard Error Copied The response must be sent within 30 seconds. Evaluate your application Here are a few sample questions and evaluation parameters. These are indicative. The actual evaluation could ask any realistic student question. To run this: Edit project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo.yaml to replace providers[0].config.url with your API URL. Run this script: npx -y promptfoo eval --config project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo.yaml Copy to clipboard Error Copied Deploy your application Deploy your application to a public URL that can be accessed by anyone. You may use any platform. (If you use ngrok, ensure that it is running continuously until you get your results.) Share your code Create a new public GitHub repository Add an MIT LICENSE file Commit and push your code Submit your URL Submit your GitHub repository URL and your API endpoint URL at https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-project-virtual-ta Evaluation Pre-requisites: Your repository MUST meet the following criteria to be eligible for evaluation Your GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible Your GitHub repository has a LICENSE file with the MIT license in the root folder We will use a modified version of project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo.yaml with 10 realistic questions. Correct answers will be awarded up to 2 marks each. Your score will be the sum of the marks above. No normalization. What you get is what you get. Bonus: 1 mark if your GitHub repo includes a script that scrapes the Discourse posts across a date range from a Discourse course page like TDS 2 marks if we deploy your solution (with minimal modifications) as an official solution for students to use.

This course exposes you to real-life tools This course is quite hard But it's probably worth it. Programming skills are a pre-requisite If you passed, don't enroll again We encourage learning by sharing You CAN copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam). Why should you copy? Because in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well. To learn well, understand what you’re copying. If you’re short of time, prioritize. To learn better, teach what you’ve learnt. We cover 7 modules in 12 weeks The content evolves with technology and feedback. Track the commit history for changes. Development Tools and concepts to build models and apps. Deployment Tools and concepts to publish what you built. Large Language Models that make your work easier and your apps smarter. Data Sourcing to get data from the web, files, and databases. Data Preparation to clean up and convert the inputs to the right format. Data Analysis to find surprising insights in the data. Data Visualization to communicate those insights as visual stories. Anyone can audit this course Everyone has access to: Course content at https://tds.s-anand.net/ Evaluations You can solve these questions any time and check your answers before the submission dates.

If you don’t specify it, it analyzes the first 30 seconds to auto-detect. You can speed it up by specifying it. Run faster-whisper-xxl --help for more options. Gemini transcription The Gemini models from Google are notable in two ways: They have a huge input context window. Gemini 2.0 Flash can accept 1M tokens, for example. They can handle audio input. This allows us to use Gemini to transcribe audio files. LLMs are not good at transcribing audio faithfully. They tend to correct errors and meander from what was said. But they are intelligent. That enables a few powerful workflows. Here are some examples: Transcribe into other languages. Gemini will handle the transcription and translation in a single step. Summarize audio transcripts. For example, convert a podcast into a tutorial, or a meeting recording into actions. Legal Proceeding Analysis. Extract case citations, dates, and other details from a legal debate. Medical Consultation Summary. Extract treatments, medications, details of next visit, etc. from a medical consultation. Here’s how to use Gemini to transcribe audio files. Get a Gemini API key from Google AI Studio. Set the GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable to the API key. Set the MP3_FILE environment variable to the path of the MP3 file you want to transcribe. Run this code: curl -X POST https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash-002:streamGenerateContent?alt=sse \\ -H \"X-Goog-API-Key: $GEMINI_API_KEY\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d \"$(cat << EOF { \"contents\": [ { \"role\": \"user\", \"parts\": [ { \"inline_data\": { \"mime_type\": \"audio/mp3\", \"data\": \"$(base64 --wrap=0 $MP3_FILE)\" } }, {\"text\": \"Transcribe this\"} ] } ] } EOF )\" Copy to clipboard Error Copied Previous Transforming Images Next 6.

Data Sourcing 5. Data Preparation 6. Data Analysis Project 2 7. Data Visualization Prompt Engineering Prompt engineering is the process of crafting effective prompts for large language models (LLMs). One of the best ways to approach prompt engineering is to think of LLMs as a smart colleague (with amnesia) who needs explicit instructions. The most authoritative guides are from the LLM providers themselves: Anthropic Google OpenAI Here are some best practices: Use prompt optimizers They rewrite your prompt to improve it. Explore: Anthropic Prompt Optimizer OpenAI Prompt Generation Google AI-powered prompt writing tools Be clear, direct, and detailed Be explicit and thorough. Include all necessary context, goals, and details so the model understands the full picture. BAD: Explain gravitation lensing. (Reason: Vague and lacks context or detail.) GOOD: Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it’s observed and its significance in astronomy. (Reason: Specifies the audience, scope, and focus.) When you ask a question, don’t be vague. Spell it out. Give every detail the listener needs. The clearer you are, the better the answer you’ll get. For example, don’t just say, Explain Gravitation Lensing. Say, Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it’s observed and its significance in astronomy. Anthropic | OpenAI | Google Give examples Provide 2-3 relevant examples to guide the model on the style, structure, or format you expect. This helps the model produce outputs consistent with your desired style. BAD: Explain how to tie a bow tie. (Reason: No examples or reference points given.) GOOD: Explain how to tie a bow tie. For example: To tie a shoelace, you cross the laces and pull them tight… To tie a necktie, you place it around the collar and loop it through… Now, apply a similar step-by-step style to describe how to tie a bow tie. (Reason: Provides clear examples and a pattern to follow.) Give examples to the model. If you want someone to build a house, show them a sketch. Don’t just say ‘build something.’ Giving examples is like showing a pattern. It makes everything easier to follow. Anthropic | OpenAI | Google Think step by step Instruct the model to reason through the problem step by step. This leads to more logical, well-structured answers. BAD: Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied? (Reason: No prompt for structured reasoning.) GOOD: Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied? Think step by step. (Reason: Directly instructs the model to break down reasoning into steps.) Ask the model to think step by step. Don’t ask the model to just give the final answer right away. That’s like asking someone to answer with the first thing that pops into their head. Instead, ask them to break down their thought process into simple moves — like showing each rung of a ladder as they climb. For example, when thinking step by step, the model could, A, list each customer question, B, find out if it was addressed, and C, decide that the agent answered only 2 out of the 3 questions. Anthropic | OpenAI | Google Assign a role Specify a role or persona for the model. This provides context and helps tailor the response style. BAD: Explain how to fix a software bug. (Reason: No role or perspective given.) GOOD: You are a seasoned software engineer. Explain how to fix a software bug in legacy code, including the debugging and testing process. (Reason: Assigns a clear, knowledgeable persona, guiding the style and depth.) Tell the model who they are. Maybe they’re a seasoned software engineer fixing a legacy bug, or an experienced copy editor revising a publication. By clearly telling the model who they are, you help them speak with just the right expertise and style. Suddenly, your explanation sounds like it’s coming from a true specialist, not a random voice. Anthropic | OpenAI | Google Use XML to structure your prompt Use XML tags to separate different parts of the prompt clearly. This helps the model understand structure and requirements. BAD: Here’s what I want: Provide a summary and then an example. (Reason: Unstructured, no clear separation of tasks.) GOOD: <instructions> Provide a summary of the concept of machine learning. </instructions> <example> Then provide a simple, concrete example of a machine learning application (e.g., an email spam filter). </example> Copy to clipboard Error Copied (Reason: Uses XML tags to clearly distinguish instructions from examples.) Think of your request like a box. XML tags are neat little labels on that box. They help keep parts sorted, so nothing gets lost in the shuffle. Anthropic | OpenAI | Google Use Markdown to format your output Encourage the model to use Markdown for headings, lists, code blocks, and other formatting features to produce structured, easily readable answers. BAD: Give me the steps in plain text. (Reason: No specific formatting instructions, less readable.) GOOD: Provide the steps in a markdown-formatted list with ### headings for each section and numbered bullet points. (Reason: Directly instructs to use Markdown formatting, making output more structured and clear.) BAD: Correct the spelling and show the corrections. (Reason: No specific formatting instructions) GOOD: Correct the spelling, showing <ins>additions</ins> and <del>deletions</del>. (Reason: Directly instructs to use HTML formatting, making output more structured and clear.) Markdown is a simple formatting language that all models understand. You can have them add neat headings, sections, bold highlights, and bullet points. These make complex documents more scannable and easy on the eyes. Use JSON for machine-readable output When you need structured data, ask for a JSON-formatted response. This ensures the output is machine-readable and organized. BAD: Just list the items. (Reason: Unstructured plain text makes parsing harder.) GOOD: Organize as an array of objects in a JSON format, like this: ```json [ { \"name\": \"Item 1\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 1\" }, { \"name\": \"Item 2\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 2\" }, { \"name\": \"Item 3\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 3\" } ] ``` Copy to clipboard Error Copied (Reason: Instructing JSON format ensures structured, machine-readable output.) Note: Always use JSON schema if possible. JSON schema is a way to describe the structure of JSON data. An easy way to get the JSON schema is to give ChatGPT sample output and ask it to generate the schema. Imagine you’re organizing data for a big project. Plain text is like dumping everything into one messy pile — it’s hard to find what you need later. JSON, on the other hand, is like packing your data into neat, labeled boxes within boxes. Everything has its place: fields like ‘name,’ ‘description,’ and ‘value’ make the data easy to read, especially for machines. For example, instead of just listing items, you can structure them as a JSON array, with each item as an object. That way, when you hand it to a program, it’s all clear and ready to use. Prefer Yes/No answers Convert rating or percentage questions into Yes/No queries. LLMs handle binary choices better than numeric scales. BAD: On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that this method works? (Reason: Asks for a numeric rating, which can be imprecise.) GOOD: Is this method likely to work as intended? Please give a reasoning and then answer Yes or No. (Reason: A binary question simplifies the response and clarifies what’s being asked.) Don’t ask ‘On a scale of one to five…’. Models are not good with numbers. They don’t know how to grade something 7 versus 8 on a 10 point scale. ‘Yes or no?’ is simple. It’s clear. It’s quick. So, break your question into simple parts that they can answer with just a yes or a no. Ask for reason first, then the answer Instruct the model to provide its reasoning steps before stating the final answer. This makes it less likely to justify itself and more likely to think deeper, leading to more accurate results. BAD: What is the best route to take? (Reason: Direct question without prompting reasoning steps first.) GOOD: First, explain your reasoning step by step for how you determine the best route. Then, after you’ve reasoned it out, state your final recommendation for the best route. (Reason: Forces the model to show its reasoning process before giving the final answer.) BEFORE making its final choice, have the model talk through their thinking. Reasoning first, answer second. That way, the model won’t be tempted to justify an answer that they gave impulsively. It is also more likely to think deeper. Use proper spelling and grammar A well-written, grammatically correct prompt clarifies expectations. Poorly structured prompts can confuse the model. BAD: xplin wht the weirless netork do? make shur to giv me a anser?? (Reason: Poor spelling and unclear instructions.) GOOD: Explain what a wireless network does. Please provide a detailed, step-by-step explanation. (Reason: Proper spelling and clarity lead to a more coherent response.) If your question sounds like gibberish, expect a messy answer. Speak cleanly. When you do, the response will be much clearer. Video Tutorials Watch Prompt Engineering Tutorial – Master ChatGPT and LLM Responses (41 min).

It’s secure: Google supports OAuth2 and OpenID Connect to handle authentication. Here’s how you build a FastAPI app that identifies the user. Go to the Google Cloud Console – Credentials and click Create Credentials > OAuth client ID. Choose Web application, set your authorized redirect URIs (e.g., http://localhost:8000/). Copy the Client ID and Client Secret into a .env file: GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret Copy to clipboard Error Copied Create your FastAPI app.py: # /// script # dependencies = [\"python-dotenv\", \"fastapi\", \"uvicorn\", \"itsdangerous\", \"httpx\", \"authlib\"] # /// import os from dotenv import load_dotenv from fastapi import FastAPI, Request from fastapi.responses import RedirectResponse from starlette.middleware.sessions import SessionMiddleware from authlib.integrations.starlette_client import OAuth load_dotenv() app = FastAPI() app.add_middleware(SessionMiddleware, secret_key=\"create-a-random-secret-key\") oauth = OAuth() oauth.register( name=\"google\", client_id=os.getenv(\"GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID\"), client_secret=os.getenv(\"GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET\"), server_metadata_url=\"https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration\", client_kwargs={\"scope\": \"openid email profile\"}, ) @app.get(\"/\") async def application(request: Request): user = request.session.get(\"user\") # 3. For authenticated users: say hello if user: return f\"Hello {user['email']}\" # 2. For users who have just logged in, save their details in the session if \"code\" in request.query_params: token = await oauth.google.authorize_access_token(request) request.session[\"user\"] = token[\"userinfo\"] return RedirectResponse(\"/\") # 1. For users who are logging in for the first time, redirect to Google login return await oauth.google.authorize_redirect(request, request.url) if __name__ == \"__main__\": import uvicorn uvicorn.run(app, port=8000) Copy to clipboard Error Copied Now, run uv run app.py. When you visit http://localhost:8000/ you’ll be redirected to a Google login page. When you log in, you’ll be redirected back to http://localhost:8000/ Now you’ll see the email ID you logged in with. Instead of displaying the email, you can show different content based on the user. For example: Allow access to specfic users and not others Fetch the user’s personalized information Display different content based on the user Previous Web Framework: FastAPI Next Local LLMs: Ollama",

Data Visualization CORS: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security mechanism that controls how web browsers handle requests between different origins (domains, protocols, or ports). Data scientists need CORS for APIs serving data or analysis to a browser on a different domain. Watch this practical explanation of CORS (3 min): Key CORS concepts: Same-Origin Policy: Browsers block requests between different origins by default CORS Headers: Server responses must include specific headers to allow cross-origin requests Preflight Requests: Browsers send OPTIONS requests to check if the actual request is allowed Credentials: Special handling required for requests with cookies or authentication If you’re exposing your API with a GET request publicly, the only thing you need to do is set the HTTP header Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *.

Data Sourcing 5. Data Preparation 6. Data Analysis Project 2 7. Data Visualization LLM Agents: Building AI Systems That Can Think and Act LLM Agents are AI systems that can define and execute their own workflows to accomplish tasks. Unlike simple prompt-response patterns, agents make multiple LLM calls, use tools, and adapt their approach based on intermediate results. They represent a significant step toward more autonomous AI systems. What Makes an Agent? An LLM agent consists of three core components: LLM Brain: Makes decisions about what to do next Tools: External capabilities the agent can use (e.g., web search, code execution) Memory: Retains context across multiple steps Agents operate through a loop: Observe the environment Think about what to do Take action using tools Observe results Repeat until task completion Command-Line Agent Example We’ve created a minimal command-line agent called llm-cmd-agent.py that: Takes a task description from the command line Generates code to accomplish the task Automatically extracts and executes the code Passes the results back to the LLM Provides a final answer or tries again if the execution fails Here’s how it works: uv run llm-cmd-agent.py \"list all Python files under the current directory, recursively, by size\" uv run llm-cmd-agent.py \"convert the largest Markdown file to HTML\" Copy to clipboard Error Copied The agent will: Generate a shell script to list files with their sizes Execute the script in a subprocess Capture the output (stdout and stderr) Pass the output back to the LLM for interpretation Present a final answer to the user Under the hood, the agent follows this workflow: Initial prompt to generate a shell script Code extraction from the LLM response Code execution in a subprocess Result interpretation by the LLM Error handling and retry logic if needed This demonstrates the core agent loop of: Planning (generating code) Execution (running the code) Reflection (interpreting results) Adaptation (fixing errors if needed) Agent Architectures Different agent architectures exist for different use cases: ReAct (Reasoning + Acting): Interleaves reasoning steps with actions Reflexion: Adds self-reflection to improve reasoning MRKL (Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language): Combines neural and symbolic modules Plan-and-Execute: Creates a plan first, then executes steps Real-World Applications LLM agents can be applied to various domains: Research assistants that search, summarize, and synthesize information Coding assistants that write, debug, and explain code Data analysis agents that clean, visualize, and interpret data Customer service agents that handle queries and perform actions Personal assistants that manage schedules, emails, and tasks Project Ideas Here are some practical agent projects you could build: Study buddy agent: Helps create flashcards, generates practice questions, and explains concepts Job application assistant: Searches job listings, tailors resumes, and prepares interview responses Personal finance agent: Categorizes expenses, suggests budgets, and identifies savings opportunities Health and fitness coach: Creates workout plans, tracks nutrition, and provides motivation Course project helper: Breaks down assignments, suggests resources, and reviews work Best Practices Clear instructions: Define the agent’s capabilities and limitations Effective tool design: Create tools that are specific and reliable Robust error handling: Agents should recover gracefully from failures Memory management: Balance context retention with token efficiency User feedback: Allow users to correct or guide the agent Limitations and Challenges Current LLM agents face several challenges: Hallucination: Agents may generate false information or tool calls Planning limitations: Complex tasks require better planning capabilities Tool integration complexity: Each new tool adds implementation overhead Context window constraints: Limited memory for long-running tasks Security concerns: Tool access requires careful permission management Previous Function Calling Next LLM Image Generation",

Data Visualization Multimodal Embeddings Multimodal embeddings map text and images into the same vector space, enabling direct comparison between, say, a caption — “A cute cat” — and an image of that cat. This unified representation powers real-world applications like: Cross-modal search (e.g. “find images of a sunset” via text queries) Content recommendation (suggesting visually similar products to text descriptions) Clustering & retrieval (grouping documents and their associated graphics) Anomaly detection (spotting unusual image–text pairings) By reducing different data types to a common numeric form, you unlock richer search, enhanced recommendations, and tighter integration of visual and textual data.

Data Preparation 6. Data Analysis Project 2 7. Data Visualization Converting HTML to Markdown When working with web content, converting HTML files to plain text or Markdown is a common requirement for content extraction, analysis, and preservation. For example: Content analysis: Extract clean text from HTML for natural language processing Data mining: Strip formatting to focus on the actual content Offline reading: Convert web pages to readable formats for e-readers or offline consumption Content migration: Move content between different CMS platforms SEO analysis: Extract headings, content structure, and text for optimization Archive creation: Store web content in more compact, preservation-friendly formats Accessibility: Convert content to formats that work better with screen readers This tutorial covers both converting existing HTML files and combining web crawling with HTML-to-text conversion in a single workflow – all using the command line. defuddle-cli defuddle-cli specializes in HTML - Markdown conversion. It’s a bit slow and not very customizable but produces clean Markdown that preserves structure, links, and basic formatting. Best for content where preserving the document structure is important. find . -name '*.html' -exec npx --package defuddle-cli -y defuddle parse {} --md -o {}.md \\; Copy to clipboard Error Copied find . -name '*.html': Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories -exec ... \\;: Executes the following command for each file found npx --package defuddle-cli -y: Installs and runs defuddle-cli without prompting defuddle parse {} --md: Parses the HTML file (represented by {}) and converts to markdown -o {}.md: Outputs to a file with the original name plus .md extension Pandoc Pandoc is a bit slow and highly customizable, preserving almost all formatting elements, leading to verbose markdown. Best for academic or documentation conversion where precision matters. Pandoc can convert from many other formats (such as Word, PDF, LaTeX, etc.) to Markdown and vice versa, making it one of most popular and versatele document convertors. find . -name '*.html' -exec pandoc -f html -t markdown_strict -o {}.md {} \\; Copy to clipboard Error Copied find . -name '*.html': Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories -exec ... \\;: Executes the following command for each file found pandoc: The Swiss Army knife of document conversion -f html -t markdown_strict: Convert from HTML format to strict markdown -o {}.md {}: Output to a markdown file, with the input file as the last argument Lynx Lynx is fast and generates text (not Markdown) with minimal formatting. Lynx renders the HTML as it would appear in a text browser, preserving basic structure but losing complex formatting. Best for quick content extraction or when processing large numbers of files. find . -type f -name '*.html' -exec sh -c 'for f; do lynx -dump -nolist \"$f\" > \"${f%.html}.txt\"; done' _ {} + Copy to clipboard Error Copied find . -type f -name '*.html': Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories -exec sh -c '...' _ {} +: Executes a shell command with batched files for efficiency for f; do ... done: Loops through each file in the batch lynx -dump -nolist \"$f\": Uses the lynx text browser to render HTML as plain text -dump: Output the rendered page to stdout -nolist: Don’t include the list of links at the end > \"${f%.html}.txt\": Save output to a .txt file with the same base name w3m w3m is very slow processing with minimal formatting. w3m tends to be more thorough in its rendering than lynx but takes considerably longer. It supports basic JavaScript processing, making it better at handling modern websites with dynamic content. Best for cases where you need slightly better rendering than lynx, particularly for complex layouts and tables, and when some JavaScript processing is beneficial. find . -type f -name '*.html' \\ -exec sh -c 'for f; do \\ w3m -dump -T text/html -cols 80 -no-graph \"$f\" > \"${f%.html}.md\"; \\ done' _ {} + Copy to clipboard Error Copied find . -type f -name '*.html': Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories -exec sh -c '...' _ {} +: Executes a shell command with batched files for efficiency for f; do ... done: Loops through each file in the batch w3m -dump -T text/html -cols 80 -no-graph \"$f\": Uses the w3m text browser to render HTML -dump: Output the rendered page to stdout -T text/html: Specify input format as HTML -cols 80: Set output width to 80 columns -no-graph: Don’t show graphic characters for tables and frames > \"${f%.html}.md\": Save output to a .md file with the same base name Comparison Approach Speed Format Quality Preservation Best For defuddle-cli Slow High Good structure and links Content migration, publishing pandoc Slow Very High Almost everything Academic papers, documentation lynx Fast Low Basic structure only Quick extraction, large batches w3m Very Slow Medium-Low Basic structure with better tables Improved readability over lynx Optimize Batch Processing Process in parallel: Use GNU Parallel for multi-core processing: find . -name \"*.html\" | parallel \"pandoc -f html -t markdown_strict -o {}.md {}\" Copy to clipboard Error Copied Filter files before processing: find . -name \"*.html\" -type f -size -1M -exec pandoc -f html -t markdown {} -o {}.md \\; Copy to clipboard Error Copied Customize output format with additional parameters: # For pandoc, preserve line breaks but simplify other formatting find . -name \"*.html\" -exec pandoc -f html -t markdown --wrap=preserve --atx-headers {} -o {}.md \\; Copy to clipboard Error Copied Handle errors gracefully: find . -name \"*.html\" -exec sh -c 'for f; do pandoc -f html -t markdown \"$f\" -o \"${f%.html}.md\" 2>/dev/null || echo \"Failed: $f\" >> conversion_errors.log; done' _ {} + Copy to clipboard Error Copied Choosing the Right Tool Need speed with minimal formatting? Use the lynx approach Need precise, complete conversion? Use pandoc Need a balance of structure and cleanliness? Try defuddle-cli Working with complex tables? w3m might render them better Remember that the best approach depends on your specific use case, volume of files, and how you intend to use the converted text. Combined Crawling and Conversion Sometimes you need to both crawl a website and convert its content to markdown or text in a single workflow, like Crawl4AI or markdown-crawler. For research/data collection: Use a specialized crawler (like Crawl4AI) with post-processing conversion For simple website archiving: Markdown-crawler provides a convenient all-in-one solution For high-quality conversion: Use wget/wget2 for crawling followed by pandoc for conversion For maximum speed: Combine wget with lynx in a pipeline Crawl4AI Crawl4AI is designed for single-page extraction with high-quality content processing. Crawl4AI is optimized for AI training data extraction, focusing on clean, structured content rather than complete site preservation. It excels at removing boilerplate content and preserving the main article text. uv venv source .venv/bin/activate.fish uv pip install crawl4ai crawl4ai-setup Copy to clipboard Error Copied uv venv: Creates a Python virtual environment using uv (a faster alternative to virtualenv) source .venv/bin/activate.fish: Activates the virtual environment (fish shell syntax) uv pip install crawl4ai: Installs the crawl4ai package crawl4ai-setup: Initializes crawl4ai’s required dependencies markdown-crawler markdown-crawler combines web crawling with markdown conversion in one tool. It’s efficient for bulk processing but tends to produce lower-quality markdown conversion compared to specialized converters like pandoc or defuddle. Best for projects where quantity and integration are more important than perfect formatting. uv venv source .venv/bin/activate.fish uv pip install markdown-crawler markdown-crawler -t 5 -d 3 -b ./markdown https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/ Copy to clipboard Error Copied uv venv and activation: Same as above uv pip install markdown-crawler: Installs the markdown-crawler package markdown-crawler: Runs the crawler with these options: -t 5: Sets 5 threads for parallel crawling -d 3: Limits crawl depth to 3 levels -b ./markdown: Sets the base output directory Final argument is the starting URL Previous Convert PDFs to Markdown Next LLM Website Scraping",

Data Sourcing 5. Data Preparation 6. Data Analysis Project 2 7. Data Visualization Embeddings: OpenAI and Local Models Embedding models convert text into a list of numbers. These are like a map of text in numerical form. Each number represents a feature, and similar texts will have numbers close to each other. So, if the numbers are similar, the text they represent mean something similar. This is useful because text similarity is important in many common problems: Search. Find similar documents to a query. Classification. Classify text into categories. Clustering. Group similar items into clusters. Anomaly Detection. Find an unusual piece of text. You can run embedding models locally or using an API. Local models are better for privacy and cost. APIs are better for scale and quality. Feature Local Models API Privacy High Dependent on provider Cost High setup, low after that Pay-as-you-go Scale Limited by local resources Easily scales with demand Quality Varies by model Typically high The Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) provides comprehensive comparisons of embedding models. These models are compared on several parameters, but here are some key ones to look at: Rank. Higher ranked models have higher quality. Memory Usage. Lower is better (for similar ranks). It costs less and is faster to run. Embedding Dimensions. Lower is better. This is the number of numbers in the array. Smaller dimensions are cheaper to store. Max Tokens. Higher is better. This is the number of input tokens (words) the model can take in a single input. Look for higher scores in the columns for Classification, Clustering, Summarization, etc. based on your needs. Local Embeddings Here’s a minimal example using a local embedding model: # /// script # requires-python = \"==3.12\" # dependencies = [ # \"sentence-transformers\", # \"httpx\", # \"numpy\", # ] # /// from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer import numpy as np model = SentenceTransformer('BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5') # A small, high quality model async def embed(text: str) -> list[float]: \"\"\"Get embedding vector for text using local model.\"\"\" return model.encode(text).tolist() async def get_similarity(text1: str, text2: str) -> float: \"\"\"Calculate cosine similarity between two texts.\"\"\" emb1 = np.array(await embed(text1)) emb2 = np.array(await embed(text2)) return float(np.dot(emb1, emb2) / (np.linalg.norm(emb1) * np.linalg.norm(emb2))) async def main(): print(await get_similarity(\"Apple\", \"Orange\")) print(await get_similarity(\"Apple\", \"Lightning\")) if __name__ == \"__main__\": import asyncio asyncio.run(main()) Copy to clipboard Error Copied Note the get_similarity function. It uses a Cosine Similarity to calculate the similarity between two embeddings. OpenAI Embeddings For comparison, here’s how to use OpenAI’s API with direct HTTP calls. Replace the embed function in the earlier script: import os import httpx async def embed(text: str) -> list[float]: \"\"\"Get embedding vector for text using OpenAI's API.\"\"\" async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client: response = await client.post( \"https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings\", headers={\"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']}\"}, json={\"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\", \"input\": text} ) return response.json()[\"data\"][0][\"embedding\"] Copy to clipboard Error Copied NOTE: You need to set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable for this to work.

Data Sourcing 5. Data Preparation 6. Data Analysis Project 2 7. Data Visualization Base 64 Encoding Base64 is a method to convert binary data into ASCII text. It’s essential when you need to transmit binary data through text-only channels or embed binary content in text formats. Watch this quick explanation of how Base64 works (3 min): Here’s how it works: It takes 3 bytes (24 bits) and converts them into 4 ASCII characters … using 64 characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, + and / (padding with = to make the length a multiple of 4) There’s a URL-safe variant of Base64 that replaces + and / with - and _ to avoid issues in URLs Base64 adds ~33% overhead (since every 3 bytes becomes 4 characters) Common Python operations with Base64: import base64 # Basic encoding/decoding text = \"Hello, World!\" # Convert text to base64 encoded = base64.b64encode(text.encode()).decode() # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ== # Convert base64 back to text decoded = base64.b64decode(encoded).decode() # Hello, World! # Convert to URL-safe base64 url_safe = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(text.encode()).decode() # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ== # Working with binary files (e.g., images) with open('image.png', 'rb') as f: binary_data = f.read() image_b64 = base64.b64encode(binary_data).decode() # Data URI example (embed images in HTML/CSS) data_uri = f\"data:image/png;base64,{image_b64}\" Copy to clipboard Error Copied Data URIs allow embedding binary data directly in HTML/CSS. This reduces the number of HTTP requests and also works offline. But it increases the file size. For example, here’s an SVG image embedded as a data URI: <img src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAzMiAzMiI+PGNpcmNsZSBjeD0iMTYiIGN5PSIxNiIgcj0iMTUiIGZpbGw9IiMyNTYzZWIiLz48cGF0aCBmaWxsPSIjZmZmIiBkPSJtMTYgNyAyIDcgNyAyLTcgMi0yIDctMi03LTctMiA3LTJaIi8+PC9zdmc+\" /> Copy to clipboard Error Copied Base64 is used in many places: JSON: Encoding binary data in JSON payloads Email: MIME attachments encoding Auth: HTTP Basic Authentication headers JWT: Encoding tokens in web authentication SSL/TLS: PEM certificate format SAML: Encoding assertions in SSO Git: Encoding binary files in patches Tools for working with Base64: Base64 Decoder/Encoder for online encoding/decoding data: URI Generator converts files to Data URIs Previous LLM Text Extraction Next Vision Models",

Data Visualization Database: SQLite Relational databases are used to store data in a structured way. You’ll often access databases created by others for analysis. PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS SQL, Oracle, etc. are popular databases. But the most installed database is SQLite. It’s embedded into many devices and apps (e.g. your phone, browser, etc.). It’s lightweight but very scalable and powerful. Watch these introductory videos to understand SQLite and how it’s used in Python (34 min): There are many non-relational databases (NoSQL) like ElasticSearch, MongoDB, Redis, etc. that you should know about and we may cover later. Core Concepts: -- Create a table CREATE TABLE users ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT NOT NULL, email TEXT UNIQUE, created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ); -- Insert data INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('Alice', 'alice@example.com'), ('Bob', 'bob@example.com'); -- Query data SELECT name, COUNT(*) as count FROM users GROUP BY name HAVING count > 1; -- Join tables SELECT u.name, o.product FROM users u LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id WHERE o.status = 'pending'; Copy to clipboard Error Copied Python Integration: import sqlite3 from pathlib import Path import pandas as pd async def query_database(db_path: Path, query: str) -> pd.DataFrame: \"\"\"Execute SQL query and return results as DataFrame.

Data Sourcing 5. Data Preparation 6. Data Analysis Project 2 7. Data Visualization Vector Databases Vector databases are specialized databases that store and search vector embeddings efficiently. Use vector databases when your embeddings exceed available memory or when you want it run fast at scale. (This is important. If your code runs fast and fits in memory, you DON’T need a vector database. You can can use numpy for these tasks.) Vector databases are an evolving space. The first generation of vector databases were written in C and typically used an algorithm called HNSW (a way to approximately find the nearest neighbor).

Data Visualization Transforming Images Image Processing with PIL (Pillow) Pillow is Python’s leading library for image processing, offering powerful tools for editing, analyzing, and generating images. It handles various formats (PNG, JPEG, GIF, etc.) and provides operations from basic resizing to complex filters. Here’s a minimal example showing common operations: # /// script # requires-python = \">=3.11\" # dependencies = [\"Pillow\"] # /// from PIL import Image, ImageEnhance, ImageFilter async def process_image(path: str) -> Image.Image: \"\"\"Process an image with basic enhancements.\"\"\" with Image.open(path) as img: # Convert to RGB to ensure compatibility img = img.convert('RGB') # Resize maintaining aspect ratio img.thumbnail((800, 800)) # Apply enhancements img = (ImageEnhance.Contrast(img) .enhance(1.2)) return img.filter(ImageFilter.SHARPEN) if __name__ == \"__main__\": import asyncio img = asyncio.run(process_image(\"input.jpg\")) img.save(\"output.jpg\", quality=85) Copy to clipboard Error Copied Key features and techniques you’ll learn: Image Loading and Saving: Handle various formats with automatic conversion Basic Operations: Resize, rotate, crop, and flip images Color Manipulation: Adjust brightness, contrast, and color balance Filters and Effects: Apply blur, sharpen, and other visual effects Drawing: Add text, shapes, and overlays to images Batch Processing: Handle multiple images efficiently Memory Management: Process large images without memory issues Basic Image Operations Common operations for resizing, cropping, and rotating images: from PIL import Image async def transform_image( path: str, size: tuple[int, int], rotation: float = 0 ) -> Image.Image: \"\"\"Transform image with basic operations.\"\"\" with Image.open(path) as img: # Resize with anti-aliasing img = img.resize(size, Image.LANCZOS) # Rotate around center if rotation: img = img.rotate(rotation, expand=True) # Auto-crop empty edges img = img.crop(img.getbbox()) return img Copy to clipboard Error Copied Color and Enhancement Adjust image appearance with built-in enhancement tools: from PIL import ImageEnhance, ImageOps async def enhance_image( img: Image.Image, brightness: float = 1.0, contrast: float = 1.0, saturation: float = 1.0 ) -> Image.Image: \"\"\"Apply color enhancements to image.\"\"\" enhancers = [ (ImageEnhance.Brightness, brightness), (ImageEnhance.Contrast, contrast), (ImageEnhance.Color, saturation) ] for Enhancer, factor in enhancers: if factor != 1.0: img = Enhancer(img).enhance(factor) return img Copy to clipboard Error Copied Filters and Effects Apply visual effects and filters to images: from PIL import ImageFilter def apply_effects(img: Image.Image) -> Image.Image: \"\"\"Apply various filters and effects.\"\"\" effects = { 'blur': ImageFilter.GaussianBlur(radius=2), 'sharpen': ImageFilter.SHARPEN, 'edge': ImageFilter.FIND_EDGES, 'emboss': ImageFilter.EMBOSS } return {name: img.filter(effect) for name, effect in effects.items()} Copy to clipboard Error Copied Drawing and Text Add text, shapes, and overlays to images: from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont async def add_watermark( img: Image.Image, text: str, font_size: int = 30 ) -> Image.Image: \"\"\"Add text watermark to image.\"\"\" draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img) font = ImageFont.truetype(\"arial.ttf\", font_size) # Calculate text size and position text_bbox = draw.textbbox((0, 0), text, font=font) text_width = text_bbox[2] - text_bbox[0] text_height = text_bbox[3] - text_bbox[1] # Position text at bottom-right x = img.width - text_width - 10 y = img.height - text_height - 10 # Add text with shadow draw.text((x+2, y+2), text, font=font, fill='black') draw.text((x, y), text, font=font, fill='white') return img Copy to clipboard Error Copied Memory-Efficient Processing Handle large images without loading them entirely into memory: from PIL import Image import os async def process_large_images( input_dir: str, output_dir: str, max_size: tuple[int, int] ) -> None: \"\"\"Process multiple large images efficiently.\"\"\" os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True) for filename in os.listdir(input_dir): if not filename.lower().endswith(('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg')): continue input_path = os.path.join(input_dir, filename) output_path = os.path.join(output_dir, filename) with Image.open(input_path) as img: # Process in chunks using thumbnail img.thumbnail(max_size) img.save(output_path, optimize=True) Copy to clipboard Error Copied Practice with these resources: Pillow Documentation: Complete API reference Python Image Processing Tutorial: In-depth guide Sample Images Dataset: Test images for practice Watch these tutorials for hands-on demonstrations: Image Processing with ImageMagick ImageMagick is a powerful command-line tool for image manipulation, offering features beyond what’s possible with Python libraries.

Large Language Models Project 1 4. Data Sourcing 5. Data Preparation 6. Data Analysis Project 2 7. Data Visualization Images: Compression Image compression is essential when deploying apps. Often, pages have dozens of images. Image analysis runs over thousands of images. The cost of storage and bandwidth can grow over time. Here are things you should know when you’re compressing images: Image dimensions are the width and height of the image in pixels. This impacts image size a lot Lossless compression (PNG, WebP) preserves exact data Lossy compression (JPEG, WebP) removes some data for smaller files Vector formats (SVG) scale without quality loss WebP is the modern standard, supporting both lossy and lossless Here’s a rule of thumb you can use as of 2025. Use SVG if you can (i.e. if it’s vector graphics or you can convert it to one) Else, reduce the image to as small as you can, and save as (lossy or lossless) WebP Common operations with Python: from pathlib import Path from PIL import Image import io async def compress_image(input_path: Path, output_path: Path, quality: int = 85) -> None: \"\"\"Compress an image while maintaining reasonable quality.\"\"\" with Image.open(input_path) as img: # Convert RGBA to RGB if needed if img.mode == 'RGBA': img = img.convert('RGB') # Optimize for web img.save(output_path, 'WEBP', quality=quality, optimize=True) # Batch process images paths = Path('images').glob('*.jpg') for p in paths: await compress_image(p, p.with_suffix('.webp')) Copy to clipboard Error Copied Command line tools include cwebp, pngquant, jpegoptim, and ImageMagick. # Convert to WebP cwebp -q 85 input.png -o output.webp # Optimize PNG pngquant --quality=65-80 image.png # Optimize JPEG jpegoptim --strip-all --all-progressive --max=85 image.jpg # Convert and resize convert input.jpg -resize 800x600 output.jpg # Batch convert mogrify -format webp -quality 85 *.jpg Copy to clipboard Error Copied Watch this video on modern image formats and optimization (15 min): Tools for image optimization: squoosh.app: Browser-based compression ImageOptim: GUI tool for Mac sharp: Node.js image processing Pillow: Python imaging library Previous Markdown Next Static hosting: GitHub Pages",

Data Preparation 6. Data Analysis Project 2 7. Data Visualization Data Sourcing Before you do any kind of data science, you obviously have to get the data to be able to analyze it, visualize it, narrate it, and deploy it. And what we are going to cover in this module is how you get the data. There are three ways you can get the data. The first is you can download the data. Either somebody gives you the data and says download it from here, or you are asked to download it from the internet because it’s a public data source. But that’s the first way—you download the data. The second way is you can query it from somewhere. It may be on a database. It may be available through an API. It may be available through a library. But these are ways in which you can selectively query parts of the data and stitch it together. The third way is you have to scrape it. It’s not directly available in a convenient form that you can query or download. But it is, in fact, on a web page. It’s available on a PDF file. It’s available in a Word document. It’s available on an Excel file. It’s kind of structured, but you will have to figure out that structure and extract it from there. In this module, we will be looking at the tools that will help you either download from a data source or query from an API or from a database or from a library. And finally, how you can scrape from different sources.

Data Sourcing 5. Data Preparation 6. Data Analysis Project 2 7. Data Visualization Large Language Models This module covers the practical usage of large language models (LLMs). LLMs incur a cost. For the May 2025 batch, use aipipe.org as a proxy. Emails with @ds.study.iitm.ac.in get a $1 per calendar month allowance. (Don’t exceed that.) Read the AI Pipe documentation to learn how to use it. But in short: Replace OPENAI_BASE_URL, i.e. https://api.openai.com/v1 with https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1... or https://aipipe.org/openai/v1... Replace OPENAI_API_KEY with the AIPIPE_TOKEN Replace model names, e.g. gpt-4.1-nano, with openai/gpt-4.1-nano For example, let’s use Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite via OpenRouter for chat completions and Text Embedding 3 Small via OpenAI for embeddings: curl https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1/chat/completions \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $AIPIPE_TOKEN\" \\ -d '{ \"model\": \"google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001\", \"messages\": [{ \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is 2 + 2?\"} }] }' curl https://aipipe.org/openai/v1/embeddings \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $AIPIPE_TOKEN\" \\ -d '{ \"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\", \"input\": \"What is 2 + 2?\" }' Copy to clipboard Error Copied Or using llm: llm keys set openai --value $AIPIPE_TOKEN export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1 llm 'What is 2 + 2?' -m openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001 export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://aipipe.org/openai/v1 llm embed -c 'What is 2 + 2' -m 3-small Copy to clipboard Error Copied For a 50% discount (but slower speed), use Flex processing by adding service_tier: \"flex\" to your JSON request. AI Proxy - Jan 2025 For the Jan 2025 batch, we had created API keys for everyone with an iitm.ac.in email to use gpt-4o-mini and text-embedding-3-small. Your usage is limited to $1 per calendar month for this course. Don’t exceed that. Use AI Proxy instead of OpenAI. Specifically: Replace your API to https://api.openai.com/... with https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/... Replace the OPENAI_API_KEY with the AIPROXY_TOKEN that someone will give you.

Data Analysis Project 2 7. Data Visualization Parsing JSON JSON is everywhere—APIs, logs, configuration files—and its nested or large structure can challenge memory and processing. In this tutorial, we’ll explore tools to flatten, stream, and query JSON data efficiently. For example, we’ll often need to process a multi-gigabyte log file from a web service where each record is a JSON object. This requires us to handle complex nested structures, large files that don’t fit in memory, or extract specific fields. Here are the key tools and techniques for efficient JSON parsing: Tool Extract from JSON… Why jq JSON in the shell Quick data exploration and pipeline processing JMESPath JSON in Python Handle complex queries with a clean syntax ijson JSON streams in Python Parse streaming/large JSON files memory-efficiently Pandas JSON columns in Python Fast analysis of structured data SQL JSON JSON in databases Combine structured and semi-structured data DuckDB JSON anywhere Fast analysis of JSON files / databases without loading to memory Examples: Use Pandas when you need to transform API responses into a DataFrame for further analysis. Leverage ijson when dealing with huge JSON logs where memory is at a premium. Apply jq for quick, iterative exploration directly in your terminal. Practice with these resources: JSONPath Online Evaluator: Test JSON queries jq play: Interactive jq query testing DuckDB JSON Tutorial: Learn DuckDB JSON functions Command-line JSON Processing with jq jq is a versatile command-line tool for slicing, filtering, and transforming JSON. It excels in quick data exploration and can be integrated into shell scripts for automated data pipelines. Example: Sifting through server logs in JSON Lines format to extract error messages or aggregate metrics without launching a full-scale ETL process. # Extract specific fields from JSONL cat data.jsonl | jq -c 'select(.type == \"user\") | {id, name}' # Transform JSON structure cat data.json | jq '.items[] | {name: .name, count: .details.count}' # Filter and aggregate cat events.jsonl | jq -s 'group_by(.category) | map({category: .[0].category, count: length})' Copy to clipboard Error Copied JMESPath Queries JMESPath offers a declarative query language to extract and transform data from nested JSON structures without needing verbose code. It’s a neat alternative when you want to quickly pull out specific values or filter collections based on conditions. Example: Extracting user emails or filtering out inactive records from a complex JSON payload received from a cloud service. import jmespath # Example queries data = { \"locations\": [ {\"name\": \"Seattle\", \"state\": \"WA\", \"info\": {\"population\": 737015}}, {\"name\": \"Portland\", \"state\": \"OR\", \"info\": {\"population\": 652503}} ] } # Find all cities with population > 700000 cities = jmespath.search(\"locations[?info.population > `700000`].name\", data) Copy to clipboard Error Copied Streaming with ijson Loading huge JSON files all at once can quickly exhaust system memory. ijson lets you stream and process JSON incrementally. This method is ideal when your JSON file is too large or when you only need to work with part of the data. Example: Processing a continuous feed from an API that returns a large JSON array, such as sensor data or event logs, while filtering on the fly. import ijson async def process_large_json(filepath: str) -> list: \"\"\"Process a large JSON file without loading it entirely into memory.\"\"\" results = [] with open(filepath, 'rb') as file: # Stream objects under the 'items' key parser = ijson.items(file, 'items.item') async for item in parser: if item['value'] > 100: # Process conditionally results.append(item) return results Copy to clipboard Error Copied Pandas JSON Columns Pandas makes it easy to work with tabular data that includes JSON strings. When you receive API data where one column holds nested JSON, flattening these structures lets you analyze and visualize the data using familiar DataFrame operations. Example: Flattening customer records stored as nested JSON in a CSV file to extract demographic details and spending patterns. import pandas as pd # Parse JSON strings in a column df = pd.DataFrame({'json_col': ['{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}', '{\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25}']}) df['parsed'] = df['json_col'].apply(pd.json_normalize) # Normalize nested JSON columns df = pd.read_csv('data.csv') df_normalized = pd.json_normalize( df['nested_json'].apply(json.loads), record_path=['items'], # List of nested objects to unpack meta=['id', 'timestamp'] # Keep these columns from parent ) Copy to clipboard Error Copied SQL JSON Functions SQL supports built-in JSON functions allow you to query and manipulate JSON stored within relational databases. These are implemented by most popular databases, including SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. This is especially handy when you have a hybrid data model, combining structured tables with semi-structured JSON columns. Example: An application that stores user settings or application logs as JSON in a SQLite database, enabling quick lookups and modifications without external JSON parsing libraries. SELECT json_extract(data, '$.name') as name, json_extract(data, '$.details.age') as age FROM users WHERE json_extract(data, '$.active') = true Copy to clipboard Error Copied DuckDB JSON Processing DuckDB shines when analyzing JSON/JSONL files directly, making it a powerful tool for data analytics without the overhead of loading entire datasets into memory. Its SQL-like syntax simplifies exploratory analysis on nested data. Example: Performing ad-hoc analytics on streaming JSON logs from a web service, such as calculating average response times or aggregating user behavior metrics. SELECT json_extract_string(data, '$.user.name') as name, avg(json_extract_float(data, '$.metrics.value')) as avg_value FROM read_json_auto('data/*.jsonl') GROUP BY 1 HAVING avg_value > 100 Copy to clipboard Error Copied Previous Profiling Data with Python Next Data Transformation with dbt",

These were generated by the OpenAI Prompt Generation tool. As a **Content Reviewer** for a high school–level course on Tools in Data Science, your job is to evaluate provided content (such as text, code snippets, or references) with a focus on correctness, clarity, and conciseness, and offer actionable feedback for improvement. 1. **Check for Correctness and Consistency** - Verify technical and factual accuracy. - Ensure internal consistency without contradictions. 2. **Check for Clarity and Approachability** - Ensure content is understandable for a high school student with limited prior knowledge. - Identify and simplify jargon or advanced concepts. 3. **Check for Conciseness** - Assess if content is direct and free of unnecessary verbosity. - Identify areas for streamlining to enhance readability. 4. **Provide Feedback for Improvement** - Offer actionable suggestions for fixing, clarifying, or reorganizing content. - Propose alternative phrasing if text is vague, complex, or verbose. # Steps 1. Carefully read the entire content before forming conclusions. 2. List factual inconsistencies or missing details causing confusion. 3. Suggest simpler terms or analogies for complex language. 4. Point out unnecessary repetition or filler text. 5. Provide direct examples of how to improve the highlighted issues. # Output Format Respond using **Markdown** with the following structure: 1. **Summary of Findings** - A concise paragraph outlining overall strengths and weaknesses. 2. **Detailed Review** - **Correctness and Consistency**: Note factual errors or inconsistencies, suggesting corrections. - **Clarity and Approachability**: Identify overly advanced or unclear sections, offering simpler alternatives. - **Conciseness**: Highlight long or repetitive sections with suggestions for tightening the text. 3. **Actionable Improvement Suggestions** - Provide specific sentences, bullet points, or rewritten examples to illustrate improvements. # Notes - Maintain a constructive review tone, not content generation. - Even if content is perfect, confirm with suggestions for minor improvements (e.g., adding an example or clarifying a subtle point).

Data Sourcing 5. Data Preparation 6. Data Analysis Project 2 7. Data Visualization Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with the CLI Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) combines retrieval (searching a knowledge base) with generation (using an LLM) to produce answers grounded in your own documents. Instead of relying solely on a general-purpose LLM, RAG lets you feed it the most relevant chunks from your corpus at query time, improving accuracy, reducing hallucinations, and allowing you to answer domain‑specific questions without fine‑tuning. In particular, you can answer questions that are hard to answer with a keyword search. For example: Q=\"What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?\" # Answer: fat arrow Q=\"What lets you walk every child node of a ts.Node?\" # Answer: node.getChildren() Q=\"What are code pieces like comments and whitespace that aren’t in the AST called?\" # Answer: trivia Q=\"Which operator converts any value into an explicit boolean?\" # Answer: !! Copy to clipboard Error Copied You can implement RAG entirely from your terminal, without writing a single line of application code. Below is a step‑by‑step example using the TypeScript book as a data source. 1. Clone the repository git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/basarat/typescript-book cd typescript-book Copy to clipboard Error Copied --depth 1 fetches only the latest commit to minimize download size. cd typescript-book moves into the project folder. You’ll now be in a new folder typescript-book containing the repo. 2.

Large Language Models Project 1 4. Data Sourcing 5. Data Preparation 6. Data Analysis Project 2 7. Data Visualization Serverless hosting: Vercel Serverless platforms let you rent a single function instead of an entire machine. They’re perfect for small web tools that don’t need to run all the time. Here are some common real-life uses: A contact form that emails you when someone wants to hire you (runs for 2-3 seconds, a few times per day) A tool that converts uploaded photos to black and white (runs for 5-10 seconds when someone uploads a photo) A chatbot that answers basic questions about your business hours (runs for 1-2 seconds per question) A newsletter sign-up that adds emails to your mailing list (runs for 1 second per sign-up) A webhook that posts your Etsy sales to Discord (runs for 1 second whenever you make a sale) You only pay when someone uses your tool, and the platform automatically handles busy periods. For example, if 100 people fill out your contact form at once, the platform creates 100 temporary copies of your code to handle them all. When they’re done, these copies disappear. It’s cheaper than running a full-time server because you’re not paying for the time when no one is using your tool - most tools are idle 95% of the time! Rather than writing a full program, serverless platforms let you write functions. These functions are called via HTTP requests. They run in a cloud environment and are scaled up and down automatically. But this means you write programs in a different style. For example: You can’t pip install packages - you have to use requirements.txt You can’t read or write files from the file system - you can only use APIs. You can’t run commands (e.g. subprocess.run()) Vercel is a cloud platform optimized for frontend frameworks and serverless functions. Vercel is tightly integrated with GitHub. Pushing to your repository automatically triggers new deployments. Here’s a quickstart. Sign-up with Vercel. Create an empty git repo with this api/index.py file. To deploy a FastAPI app, add a requirements.txt file with fastapi as a dependency. fastapi Copy to clipboard Error Copied Add your FastAPI code to a file, e.g. main.py. # main.py from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI() @app.get(\"/\") def read_root(): return {\"message\": \"Hello, World!\"} Copy to clipboard Error Copied Add a vercel.json file to the root of your repository. { \"builds\": [{ \"src\": \"main.py\", \"use\": \"@vercel/python\" }], \"routes\": [{ \"src\": \"/(.*)\", \"dest\": \"main.py\" }] } Copy to clipboard Error Copied On the command line, run: npx vercel to deploy a test version npx vercel --prod to deploy to production Environment Variables. Use npx vercel env add to add environment variables. In your code, use os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY') to access them. Videos Previous Notebooks: Google Colab Next CI/CD: GitHub Actions",
