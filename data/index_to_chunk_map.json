There was no mention of any bonus marks, and we were not informed about the +5 bonus marks for GA7 before the deadline. Because of other academic commitments like Project 2, some of us couldn\u2019t complete GA7.\nRecently, we found out that some students received an email saying they\u2019ve been given +5 bonus marks for GA7, which directly affects their final score and possibly their overall grade. Since this information wasn\u2019t shared earlier, we kindly request you to consider offering an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn the bonus marks. This could be through a submission review or another form of assessment.\nWe genuinely hope for your understanding and would be very grateful if you could provide a chance for us to earn the bonus marks too.\nBest regards,",

Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).\nWhy should you copy?\nBecause in real life, there\u2019s no time to re-invent the wheel. You\u2019ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It\u2019s important to learn how to do that well.\nTo learn well, understand\nwhat you\u2019re copying. If you\u2019re short of time, prioritize.\nTo learn better, teach\nwhat you\u2019ve learnt.\nNow will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself).\nOnce again Anand has a\nnice blog",

It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this).\nThe value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team.\nThe ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly\nWorkflow of ROE: Data Extraction \u2192 Data Cleaning \u2192 Data Transformation \u2192 Data Analyisis \u2192 Information to answer questions",

The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE.\nPast terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE.

(Some have Gate exam on Saturday also). So, extending the timeline to at least Sunday, 16th Feb would be truly appreciated.\nWeek 3 release date timeline is 24 Jan, we need adequate time to go through the weekly materials. All the contents are already released, so by the same logic upcoming Project 2 contents are also available but that doesn\u2019t mean that we can complete the upcoming project within a week.\nProject help sessions came on 11th February(live) and 12th Feb on YouTube, just 4 days before the submission date, though I am not complaining about this and genuinely appreciating the team\u2019s effort, but this does gives very less time for many of us here.\nThank you.",

Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended.\nHave you watched this session in particular?",

My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation.

The main reasons why you should use virtual environments:\nIsolation\n\u2013 Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects.\nReproducibility\n\u2013 A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies.\nPortability\n\u2013 You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering.\nInstalling with pip individually (pip install package-name)\n\u2022 Good for quick experimentation and testing.\n\u2022 Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time.\nUsing requirements.txt\n\u2022 Best for\nreproducibility\nand\ncollaboration\nsince others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.",

Is this fair? we are loosing marks for the exam in which almost no one can score average. This situation is causing CGPAs to drop significantly. I request the team to consider this issue.

For e.g., if I score a lower than expected grade and I am feeling demotivated, I can understand what you just wrote and it is indeed very much to the point.\nHowever, if the entire grading bell curve has shifted and most students are not scoring grades as per expectation, it is time for the instructors to consider whether the grading pattern needs to be tweaked (20% for an \u201cimpossible\u201d ROE is perhaps on the higher side) or students need to be provided with alternate paths to a decent grade (like extra assignments for 10-20 marks in lieu of the loss of marks above mentioned ROE).",

Some know 50%. They\u2019ll answer those in a few seconds.\nSome, they can FIND out. with Google, StackOverflow, ChatGPT. That\u2019s explicit learning. But it takes time.\nSome, they just CAN\u2019T find out. Maybe the terminology is unclear. Maybe their skill set is different.\nThe RoE evaluates how much of learning is implicit. (Projects test how much is explicit.)\nCan you answer 17 Q in 30 m?\nHopefully not.\nI hope this is at the edge of the class\u2019 competence. If multiple people answer all 17, I\u2019ll suggest 20 Q in 30 m next time, or pick tougher questions.\n(This sounds harsh. Over time, though, I\u2019ve come to value frank feedback over polite encouragement.)",

Practice regularly. Pick problems just outside the edge of competence (fail 50% of the time).\nSocial learning\n. Observe experts & peers and internalize their strategies. We\u2019re social animals and learn faster through mimicry.\nEmotional engagement\n. If we like it or enjoy it, we learn faster. Practicing on real-world problems or problems we enjoy solving, working with people we enjoy, helps.\nIs it worth it?\nMaybe not.\nNot all implicit learning is worth it.\nYou may not need it. 10 years ago, as a data scientist, scraping was worth learning implicitly. Today, as a manager, I\u2019d just hire someone to do it.\nYou may not be good at it. When I got a \u201cD\u201d in German, followed by a \u201cD\u201d in Japanese, I realized I\u2019m just not mentally wired for human languages. It\u2019d be too much effort to learn.",

This was a deliberate choice as the content is strictly speaking owned by IITM. Embeddings may allow others to monetise content without the appropriate permissions.\nI will enquire on your behalf. I accept that not every channel follows the directives properly, so you might find it possible to embed other channel videos from IITM, but I can only go by the agreed upon protocols.\nI know that\u2019s not much comfort, but if its possible, I will amend the permissions.\nKind regards",

Embedding is another way which can stop the recommendations and the advertisements.\nHope to hear soon,\nRegards",
